# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it, one letter at a time.

It is coded using Python, using while and if loops to define functions that check whether the guess is contained within the target word, and whether it is a valid input.
